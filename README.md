# Canadian Content
Adds Canadian stuff to Minecraft

Major features:
- Moose mob: Tameable, saddleable mount that can swim. They shed their antlers occassionally or when hurt. Drops leather and venison on death. Spawns in cold forested biomes. Drops mob head when blown up by a charged creeper.
- Beaver mob: Chops and replants trees. Feed maple syrup to refresh chopping fatigue (~10 minute cooldown) or feed poutine/donair/pierogi to send into a chopping frenzy. Drops beaver pelts on death. Spawns in forests and rivers.
- Tree tap: Place block on trees to get types of sap: Maple sap from maple trees, resin from pale oak, sap from all other trees. Works as a villager job site for new Lumberjack villager (buys/sells items from the mod). Crafted using copper and a bucket.
- Cooking pot: 2x2 crafting grid that requires fuel to use. Used to cook maple sap into maple syrup and to cook new Canadian dishes (poutine/donair/pierogi). Crafted using a cauldron and a furnace.
- Maple forest biome: Filled with maple trees (new red-tinted wood type). Locate using a cartographer trade for a Maple Forest Cabin map (a lumberjack lives here).
- Beaver and moose head gear: Beaver pelt hat speeds up your axe chopping speed, and the moose antler hat increases your base HP while worn.

To flesh out these features the mod adds a number of minor features:
- Flour as an intermediate ingredient.
- Cooking pot enables creating a number of base game items with alternate recipes: Most soups with fewer ingredients, slime balls from flour and sap.
- Rubber balls made from cooking sap with fermented spider eyes.
- Rubber blocks: Bouncy like a slime block without piston interactions or slowed walking speed.
- Thermos: Made from iron and rubber. Acts as a bundle that carries only single stack consumables. Lets you have a stack of 64 soups/drinks/potions. Interacting consumes the first one in the stack.
- Gravy and cheese curd foods as ingredients for poutine. Both made in the cooking pot.
- Lumberjack villager: If you can't find a maple biome, the lumberjack can sell you maple saplings at level 2 (workstation: tree tap).
